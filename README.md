# tiles

## How to use program
Click the mouse on one of the 24 tiles on the board. This should select the tile for comparison. Click another matching tile and the matching sections should turn white.

## Debugging tools
The system prints out a message telling  you if you've made a valid move (within the parameters of one tile and/or there is a match on that tile). Messages also print for mouse clicks and click coordinates.

## Known bugs/unfinished design features
GUI layout is wrong size, 24th tile is black, GUI doesn't update.
